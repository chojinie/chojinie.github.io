<p>
I'm a researcher at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kitech-kmai/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">KMAI</a> of <a href="https://eng.kitech.re.kr/main/" target="_blank">KITECH</a>. Before joining KITECH, I hold a master's degree in AI Imaging(advised by Prof. Jongwon Choi) from Chung-Ang University(CAU). I am affiliated with <a href="https://www.vilab.cau.ac.kr/" target="_blank">VILAB</a> at CAU. Earlier in my career, I worked as a Sales Development Representative (SDR) at the <a href="https://en.fasoo.com/" target="_blank">Fasoo</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here are some key questions that guide my research:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Human Behavior Understanding Systems:</strong> Do models that perform tasks related to the human bodyâ€”such as detecting or estimating human posesâ€”truly understand the state of the person?</li>
  <li><strong>Foundation VLM models:</strong> Is it possible to build a vision-language foundation model that encompasses both expert-level and general domains?</li>
</ul>
